Arduino based DMX ArtNet-Node

Or how make an Art-Net node for less than $ 30

In this post we show you how to build an Art-Net node based on Arduino Mega with two output DMX universes (1024 DMX channels). This node answers to the basic messages of the Art-Net protocol, so that any controller that meets the protocol will be able to detect it and use it as DMX output.

What do we need?

- An Arduino UNO or Arduino Mega 2560 or 1280, the code has been tested with Arduino UNO and Mega 2560, should work without problems in 1280.

- A shield-based ethernet Wiznet W5100 (Arduino ethershield)

- The DMX shield based on included schematic.  (you can also use max 485 boards or make your own)

- Library Deskontrol 4 DMX universes (included in package)

- Arduino IDE v0023 (The code for the Art-Net node does not work for now with higher versions)


Installation Instructions:

Copy the folder "Dmx" included in the package to the folder arduino-0023/libraries/

Copy the folder "artnet_node" to Arduino sketches folder, in my case "Arduino"

Now we can open the sketch of the "artnet_node", compile the code and upload to Arduino.

To test the performance I have used the software "MADRIX",the utility "DmxWorkshop" of Artistic license, and the utility "artnet-discover" that is part of the library libartnet of Simon Newton. All these programs are for windows, if you want to try Linux you can use "Q-light." (Configure your computer with the IP 2.0.0.1, subnet-mask 255.0.0.0, gateway 2.0.0.1)

I hope to share your experiences in the Blog.
