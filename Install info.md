# Toni-Merino-Artnet-Code
This is the code for a Multi universe artnet node Made by Toni Merino and published on deskontol,  however, this seems to no longer exist or be accessible. therefore i have uploaded the stuff i had saved to here. None of this is my own

Extra info:
You will need to add this to your board using arduino ide v0023
which can be downloaded from the old google archive here: https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/arduino/arduino-0023.zip
