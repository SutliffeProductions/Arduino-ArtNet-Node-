# Toni-Merino-Artnet-Code
This is the code for a Multi universe artnet node Made by Toni Merino and published on deskontol,  however, this seems to no longer exist or be accessible. therefore i have uploaded the stuff i had saved to here. None of this is my own
This code gives you a lot of flexibility with output, Networking and memory, which are not easily editable all solutions.

Extra info:
You will need to add this to your board using arduino ide v0023
which can be downloaded from the old google archive here: https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/arduino/arduino-0023.zip

YOu will also need to wire your dmx output device according to the photo provided, or as outlined in the code (this can be changed ofc)

If you have any issues feel free to comment.
